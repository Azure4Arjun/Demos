# Start with What-are-PowerShell-Notebooks

## Next have a look at What-is-Better-About-DotNET-Interactive-PowerShell-Notebooks

This Notebook contains a few small features I think you're going to want to know about.

## After that, please take a look at the demos copied from the .NET Interactive repo

I copied them here to make this Jupyter Book a fluid experience.  However, I do not regulalry check for updated versions of these Notebooks.  There should be a link at the top of each file to take you to the latest version currently merged into the dotnet/interactive repo.
